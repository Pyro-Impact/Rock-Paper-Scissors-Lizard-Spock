# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock
This game is a modification (from a TV show) of RPS and includes 2 new choices in the game.

The code from my first rock paper scissors game was modified to include these 2 new choices.
I also added:
1. new verbs for draws and winning actions
2. an "in" statement within the if statement because values in the dictionary equaled more than one item

This code still has the nice function of program looping.
